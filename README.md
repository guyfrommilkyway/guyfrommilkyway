## Hi, I'm Almer ðŸ‘‹
A coder and designer with over a year of professional experience in front-end web development. Experience in building web applications, from developing interfaces to integrating data and services. My expertise is currently somewhere in the realm of JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Redux, Zustand, Tailwind and Chakra UI.

Most recently I've worked at Seaplane Group, a Hong Kong-based startup company, where I was assigned to maintain and developer user-facing features for two company projects. Prior to joining Seaplane Group, I've worked at Highly Succeed Inc., a Philippine-based company offering a diverse range of IT services. During my tenure, I've had the opportunity to co-develop web applications for private and government clients.

As a lifelong learner, I'm passionate and dedicated to continuous learning. To stay at the forefront of the ever-evolving tech landscape, I spend significant time and effort to investing in my personal growth and development. In these past few days, I've been broadening my existing skill set and expertise into adjacent domains, encompassing user experience, backend development, and the intricacies of devops.

When not on my working station, you'll often find me engaged in spending quality time with my loyal German Shepherd, Comet, forging a bond while honing our skills together. When not in training mode, my other canine companions, Brew and Latte, eargerly join the mix, creating a playful and vibrant atmosphere. In addition, I occasionally indulge in watching TV series such as SEAL Team, The Big Bang Theory and Suits. I'm also an enthusiastic gamer with a particular fondness for real-time strategy, single-player campaigns with compelling narratives, and tactical shooter games.
