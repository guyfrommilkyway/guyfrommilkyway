## Hi, I'm Almer ðŸ‘‹

An agile software developer with over a year of professional experience specializing in front-end web development. I'm experience in building seamless user experiences, utilizing JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Redux, Zustand, Tailwind and Chakra UI.

Most recently I've worked at Seaplane Group, a Hong Kong-based startup company, where I've took ownership of the maintenance and development of two company projects. Prior to this, I've worked at Highly Succeed Inc., a Philippine-based company offering a range of IT services. During my tenure, I've had the opportunity to co-develop a total of eight web applications for private and government clients.

As a lifelong learner, I'm dedicated to continuous learning. To keep up with the fast-changing tech industry, I spend significant time and effort to investing in my personal growth and development. In these past few days, I've been building up foundational knowledge into adjacent domains of user experience, back-end development, and the intricacies of DevOps.

Currently, I'm seeking new opportunities in the field of front-end development and open to embracing and mastering emerging technologies. I'm excited to contribute my expertise, passion and dedication to create exceptional user experiences for startups and small businesses.
